## Setting up a webhook

To set up a webhook, you can create one in the Enzo dashboard settings under the "Developer" tab

## Verifying webhook requests from Enzo

Enzo will sign each webhook request using a secret unique to the webhook. You can use this signature along with the timestamp to verify that the request is coming from Enzo as well as protect against replay attacks.

### Steps to verify a webhook request from Enzo

At a high level, the steps to verify a webhook request from Enzo are:

1. Retrieve the timestamp of the request from `x-enzo-request-timestamp`, the body of the request, and the signing secret associated with the webhook.
2. Concatenate the timestamp and request body using the following format:
   `v0:${timestamp}:${requestBody}`
3. Compute a HMAC 256 digest on the resulting string using the signing secret as the key. The secret can be found in the webhooks table under the "Developer" tab

4. Compare this digest with the signature provided in `x-enzo-request-signature`. If they are equal, then the request is verified to be from Enzo.

Here is pseudocode in Javascript to perform the verification:

```typescript
  import crypto from "crypto";

  // retrieve from x-enzo-request-timestamp
  const timestamp = 1707777128;

  const requestBodyString = JSON.stringify(request.body);

  // retrieve from the webhook details on the "Developers" tab
  const signingSecret = "wss_C...l";

  const message = `v0:${timestamp}:${requestBodyString}`;
  const expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac("sha256", signingSecret).update(message).digest("hex");

  // retrieve from x-enzo-request-signature
  const receivedSignature = "d3a8d5de6d463023b052ee1eb8e7f247dce6bf90b4a3e1117b4922afdc90029b";

  if (expectedSignature === receivedSignature) {
    // proceed
  }
```
