  Details for each can be found in the Output and Config types page.

- **initialOutput** (object)  
  The initial raw output from the document processor. This is always set.
  The shape of output depends on the document processor `type`.
  Details for each can be found in the Output and Config types page.

- **reviewedOutput** (object)  
  An optional field that shows the output after review, if applicable.
  The shape of output depends on the document processor `type`.
  Details for each can be found in the Output and Config types page.

### Example
```json
{
  "object": "document_processor_run",
  "id": "dpr_1234",
  "edited": true,
  "type": "EXTRACT",
  "initialOutput": {
    "is_invoice": {
      "id": "field6",
      "type": "boolean",
      "value": true,
      "confidence": 1,
      "references": []
    },
    "line_items": {
      "id": "field3",
      "type": "array",
      "value": [
        {
          "quantity": 1,
          "unit_price": {
            "amount": 4.316,
            "iso_4217_currency_code": "USD"
          },
          "description": "CHEESE CHEDDAR SHARP PRIN SYS2822312"
        }
      ],
      "confidence": 0.51,
      "references": []
    }
  },
  "reviewedOutput": {
    // Same structure as initialOutput, but with reviewed values
  },
  "output": {
    // Final output, either reviewed or initial
  }
}
```

The exact shape of `initialOutput`, `reviewedOutput`, and `output` will depend on the processor type (EXTRACT, CLASSIFY, etc.) and the specific configuration of that processor. The example above shows a partial extract processor output with invoice fields.

Each field in these outputs typically includes:
- An ID
- The field type (string, boolean, array, etc.)
- The extracted value
- A confidence score
- Any references to locations in the source document where the information was found
