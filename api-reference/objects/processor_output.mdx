# Processor Output

The Processor Output object represents the structured data extracted by an Enzo document processor. It contains fields, subfields, insights, confidence scores, and references to the original document.

## Structure

A processor output contains one or more field objects, each representing a specific type of extracted information.

### Properties

- **fields** (array)  
  An array of field objects extracted from the document.

- **processorId** (string)  
  A unique identifier for the document processor that generated this output.

### Field Object

Each field in the processor output represents a specific type of information extracted from the document.

- **id** (string)  
  A unique identifier for the field.

- **name** (string)  
  The name of the field, describing the type of information it contains.

- **type** (string)  
  The data type of the field (e.g., "object", "array", "string", "date").

- **description** (string)  
  A description of what the field represents.

- **value** (object)  
  The extracted value for this field, which may contain nested subfields.

  - **subfields** (array)  
    An array of subfield objects that provide more detailed information about the field.

  - **insights** (array)  
    Additional insights or analysis derived from the field data.

  - **confidence** (number)  
    A confidence score between 0 and 1 indicating the processor's confidence in the extracted information.

  - **references** (array)  
    References to the original document where this information was extracted from.

### Subfield Object

Subfields provide more granular information about a field.

- **id** (string)  
  A unique identifier for the subfield.

- **name** (string)  
  The name of the subfield.

- **type** (string)  
  The data type of the subfield (e.g., "string", "date", "number").

- **description** (string)  
  A description of what the subfield represents.

## Example

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "field_Tz9",
      "name": "activity_restrictions",
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Any restrictions on the patient's activities",
      "value": {
        "subfields": [
          {
            "id": "subfield_Ii1",
            "name": "text",
            "type": "string",
            "description": "the verbatim quote from the medical record."
          },
          {
            "id": "subfield_XGH",
            "name": "date",
            "type": "date",
            "description": "when was the restriction given?"
          }
        ],
        "insights": [],
        "confidence": 0,
        "references": []
      }
    }
  ],
  "processorId": "dp_k4taf8H1eZVDKB0YQUda_"
}
```

## Common Field Types

Depending on the document processor, various field types may be extracted:

- **Patient Demographics**: Information about the patient such as name, date of birth, gender, etc.
- **Medical History**: Patient's past medical conditions and treatments.
- **Diagnoses**: Current medical conditions with associated ICD codes.
- **Medications**: Current medications with dosage, frequency, and route.
- **Vital Signs**: Measurements like blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc.
- **Lab Results**: Laboratory test results with reference ranges.
- **Activity Restrictions**: Limitations on patient activities as shown in the example.
- **Treatment Plans**: Recommended treatments and follow-up care.

## Field Confidence

The confidence score indicates how certain the processor is about the extracted information:

- **0.9-1.0**: Very high confidence, likely accurate
- **0.7-0.9**: High confidence
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate confidence
- **0.3-0.5**: Low confidence
- **0.0-0.3**: Very low confidence, may require manual review

Fields with low confidence scores may need human verification before being used for clinical decision-making.
