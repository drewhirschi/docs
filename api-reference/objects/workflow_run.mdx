The WorkflowRun object is the core object of the WorkflowRun API. It represents a single run of a workflow and contains all the information about the run, including the output data, the workflow that was run, and the status of the run.

### Properties

- **object** (string)  
  The type of the object, in this case it will always be "workflow_run".

- **id** (string)  
  An ID corresponding to a specific File x Workflow combination representing the specific WorkflowRun for a File.

- **name** (string)  
  The name of the WorkflowRun. Autogenerated by Enzo using fileName if not provided at creation time.

- **status** (string)  
  The status of a WorkflowRun. The options are:

  - "PENDING" (if the WorkflowRun is still running)
  - "FAILED" (if the WorkflowRun failed)
  - "REVIEWED" (if the WorkflowRun has been manually reviewed and corrected)
  - "PROCESSED" (if the WorkflowRun is fully processed)

- **fileId** (string)  
  The ID of the File created as part of this WorkflowRun.

- **fileName** (string)  
  The name of the File associated with this WorkflowRun.

- **fileUrl** (string)  
  A URL internal to Enzo for the file. This URL is not public and will not be accessible without the proper authentication.

- **fileMetadata** (oneOf)  
  Metadata about the file. This is an optional field which will only be present once the file has finished processing. The shape of the object depends on the type of file that was processed.

- **initialRunAt** (string)  
  The time (in UTC) at which the workflow was initially run.

- **failureMessage** (string)  
  An optional field that will only be present if applicable. This will be the error message if the WorkflowRun failed.

- **reviewedBy** (string)  
  An optional field that will only be present if applicable. This will be the user ID of the person who reviewed the WorkflowRun.

- **reviewedAt** (string)  
  An optional field that will only be present if applicable. The time (in UTC) at which the WorkflowRun review step was completed.

- **startTime** (string)  
  The start time (in UTC) of the WorkflowRun.

- **endTime** (string)  
  An optional field that will only be present if applicable. The end time (in UTC) of the WorkflowRun.

- **outputs** (DocumentProcessorRun[])  
  An array of DocumentProcessorRun objects corresponding to Extraction, Classification, and Instruct QA steps. This will contain the initial output, reviewed output, and final output of the DocumentProcessorRun.

- **workflow** (Workflow)  
  The details about the Workflow that was used in this WorkflowRun.

- **stepRuns** (WorkflowStepRun[])  
  An array of WorkflowStepRun objects. Each WorkflowStepRun represents a single run of a WorkflowStep and contains details about the step and the run's output.

  **Note:** This field currently supports External Data Validation and Rule Validation step types. Document processor run outputs are included in the `outputs` field.

Would you like me to expand on any of these properties with more detailed documentation of their sub-properties and types?
